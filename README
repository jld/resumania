This is the résumé formatter I wrote when I was graduating from college
in 2003, and dusted off whenever I've needed to apply for jobs since
then.  It also has the source code for my actual résumé (complete with
asides and notes-to-self in comments) and a few historical versions --
as usage examples if anyone felt like trying to actually use this thing,
and as part of publishing my résumé for the usual reasons one does that.

The revision history for this repo is a little odd; it was originally
maintained in CVS (at a time in my life when, apparently, I didn't even
try to keep multiple functional changes in separate commits), and then
"versioned" by copy-and-edit on the resume source on the infrequent
occasions after my first job when I needed to touch it.

It was probably part of a larger scheme to generate the low-level
formatting seen here from a high-level declarative description, but in
practice the only problem that proved worth solving was that of having
the same document in multiple markup formats, which this accomplished.
